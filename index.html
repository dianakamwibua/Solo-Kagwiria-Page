    <p>The day is Thursday and after a serious struggle with understanding the content,l can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel</p>
    <p>It has been a long week, faced with the vulnerability of the unknown.</p>
    <p>Diving deep into a learning process so strange to you.</p>
    <P>Yet it has the greatest achievement of the week.</P>
    <p>To close it all, l look forward to my IP and how best l can do it.</p>
